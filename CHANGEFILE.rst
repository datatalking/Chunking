# Fixing Data

1. when pythonspeed wrote the tutorial they didnt include the data
2. could not find via google search, found possible analog in github
3. data found but the pandas.read_csv is deprecated
4. might have a bad install of pandas, 'pip uninstall pandas' then 'pip install pandas'
4. change 'pandas.read_csv' to 'pd.read.csv'
5. tried adding '__init__.py' to the project root folder
6. change 'pandas.read.csv' back to 'pd.read_csv'
7. worked
